## Motive

**Inspired by Japanese artist [SHO SHIBUYA](https://www.shoshibuya.com/sunrise-from-a-small-window/)**, I had the idea of making a journaling app instead of abusing my notes app. 

The idea is relatively simple: create a front page of your own Journal with a headline, a hero shot (aka Cut), and an optional 700-character column for the story body, and voila, you've just made a piece of contemporary art while reflecting on your day-to-day life.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: flex-start;">
  <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 0;">

## Design thoughts

- The logo features "la vérité" painting by Jules Joseph, showing a woman holding a mirror to represent "self-reflection" which is the whole idea of journaling.
- The Journal's design mimics Shibuya's work with the New York Times front pages, which includes :
   - Using a 6/11 width-to-height ratio, and keeping that consistent across landscape and portrait screens
   - Using Chomsky font for Journals' titles and Georgia for headlines and story body
   - Adding a folding effect in the middle of the journal
- Using authentic industry terminology (masthead -> journal title) (cut -> journal hero shot) (byline -> journal author)
- Adding a typewriter sound effect for a more enjoyable user experience

## Future work
**Right now, this's just an MVP of what the front page has the potential to be**
- Archives, users can only save their journals as images right now
- More Journal templates and more dynamic editorial options
- Arabic style journal
- communities, follow your friends' journals and see their **public** journals
- Integrate with Instagram to facilitate a share-to-your-story option
- AI-powered cut image suggestions
